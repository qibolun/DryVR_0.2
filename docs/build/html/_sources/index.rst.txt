==================================
:Release: 0.2
:Date: 11/08/2017


DryVR is a framework for verifying cyber-physical systems. It specifically handles systems that are described by a combination of a :ref:`black-box-label` for trajectories and a white-box :ref:`transition-graph-label` specifying mode switches. The framework uses a probabilistic algorithm for learning sensitivity of the continuous trajectories from simulation data and includes a bounded reachability analysis algorithm that uses the learned sensitivity.
